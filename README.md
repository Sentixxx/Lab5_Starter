### 1. Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.
No, because there's to be a process in sending and receiving, which contains many factors like network, server and so on. There dependencies are far more than unit tests can include.

### 2. Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.
Yes, I will. Because this is a very easy test. It has a very clear and simple input and output, and can be ran very fast.
